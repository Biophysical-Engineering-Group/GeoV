# GeoV
This project aims to be a toolbox for the geometric analysis of Biological vesicles from microscopy data


## Thanks
First of all I would like to say that this project is largely based on the two python packages pymeshlab and polyscope, found under the following links:

https://polyscope.run/py/

and 

https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/PyMeshLab

polyscope was developed by Nick Sharp and others and pymeshlab was developes by The Visual computing lab- ISTI - CNR

Many thanks for the great work the developers have done and providing these tools as Open Source for everyone to use

## A small Request at the beginning:

As this project is only now about to become public many bugs and incompletness cannot be avoided. We are therefore very thankful for any bug report feedback inspiration and new ideas of what could still be implemented. We always try to help! Especially if there is a problem with the installation don't hesitate to ask for help!

## Installation

The program is currently unfortunaltely only available on Linux (Tested on Ubuntu) and Windows. For Mac a more complicated manual installation process is provided
